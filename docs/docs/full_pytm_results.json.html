      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Overflow Buffers&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Buffer Overflow attacks target improper or missing bounds checking on buffer operations, typically triggered by input injected by an adversary. As a consequence, an adversary is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the adversaries&#x27; choice.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.checksInputBounds is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking. Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow. If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking. Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution. Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution. Utilize static source code analysis tools to identify potential buffer overflow weaknesses in the software.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Authentication Abuse/ByPass&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An attacker obtains unauthorized access to an application, service or device either through knowledge of the inherent weaknesses of an authentication mechanism, or by exploiting a flaw in the authentication scheme&#x27;s implementation. In such an attack an authentication mechanism is functioning but a carefully controlled sequence of events causes the mechanism to grant access to the attacker. This attack may exploit assumptions made by the target&#x27;s authentication procedures, such as assumptions regarding trust relationships or assumptions regarding the generation of secret values. This attack differs from Authentication Bypass attacks in that Authentication Abuse allows the attacker to be certified as a valid user through illegitimate means, while Authentication Bypass allows the user to access protected material without ever being certified as an authenticated user. This attack does not rely on prior sessions established by successfully authenticating users, as relied upon for the Exploitation of Session Variables, Resource IDs and other Trusted Credentials attack patterns.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Double Encoding&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;The adversary utilizes a repeating of the encoding process for a set of characters (that is, character encoding a character encoding of a character) to obfuscate the payload of a particular request. This may allow the adversary to bypass filters that attempt to detect illegal characters or strings, such as those that might be used in traversal or injection attacks. Filters may be able to catch illegal encoded strings, but may not catch doubly encoded strings. For example, a dot (.), often used in path traversal attacks and therefore often blocked by filters, could be URL encoded as %2E. However, many filters recognize this encoding and would still block the request. In a double encoding, the % in the above URL encoding would be encoded again as %25, resulting in %252E which some filters might not catch, but which could still be interpreted as a dot (.) by interpreters on the target.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your decoding process against malicious input. Be aware of the threat of alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP address encoding. When client input is required from web-based forms, avoid using the GET method to submit data, as the method causes the form data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use the POST method whenever possible. Any security checks should occur after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation process.Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL. Regular expression can be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL requests if the regular expression is too restrictive. There are tools to scan HTTP requests to the server for valid URL such as URLScan from Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx).&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Privilege Abuse&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or non-privileged accounts. Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure that only authorized users are able to access these resources. If access control mechanisms are absent or misconfigured, a user may be able to access resources that are intended only for higher level users. An adversary may be able to exploit this to utilize a less trusted account to gain information and perform activities reserved for more trusted accounts. This attack differs from privilege escalation and other privilege stealing attacks in that the adversary never actually escalates their privileges but instead is able to use a lesser degree of privilege to access resources that should be (but are not) reserved for higher privilege accounts. Likewise, the adversary does not exploit trust or subvert systems - all control functionality is working as configured but the configuration does not adequately protect sensitive resources at an appropriate level.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Buffer Manipulation&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An adversary manipulates an application&#x27;s interaction with a buffer in an attempt to read or modify data they shouldn&#x27;t have access to. Buffer attacks are distinguished in that it is the buffer space itself that is the target of the attack rather than any code responsible for interpreting the content of the buffer. In virtually all buffer attacks the content that is placed in the buffer is immaterial. Instead, most buffer attacks involve retrieving or providing more input than can be stored in the allocated buffer, resulting in the reading or overwriting of other unintended program memory.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.usesSecureFunctions is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;To help protect an application from buffer manipulation attacks, a number of potential mitigations can be leveraged. Before starting the development of the application, consider using a code language (e.g., Java) or compiler that limits the ability of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g., C) then consider using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used, make sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally, there are often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g., StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and protect against potential buffer issues. Finally, there may be operating system level preventative functionality that can be applied.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Flooding&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target&#x27;s operations. The key factor in a flooding attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number, the more likely an attack is to succeed against a given target.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.handlesResourceConsumption is False or target.controls.isResilient is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale configured. Specify expectations for capabilities and dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches limits. Uniformly throttle all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Excessive Allocation&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An adversary causes the target to allocate excessive resources to servicing the attackers&#x27; request, thereby reducing the resources available for legitimate services and degrading or denying services. Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s). Often this attack takes advantage of a bug in the target to cause the target to allocate resources vastly beyond what would be needed for a normal request.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.handlesResourceConsumption is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Assume all input is malicious. Consider all potentially relevant properties when validating input. Consider uniformly throttling all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed. Use resource-limiting settings, if possible.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Format String Injection&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An adversary includes formatting characters in a string input field on the target application. Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Limit the usage of formatting string functions. Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal formatting characters.&quot;,

      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.checksInputBounds is False and target.controls.validatesInput is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;The client software should not install untrusted code from a non-authenticated server. The client software should have the latest patches and should be audited for vulnerabilities before being used to communicate with potentially hostile servers. Perform input validation for length of buffer inputs. Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking. Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution. Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution. Ensure all buffer uses are consistently bounds-checked. Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Command Delimiters&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An attack of this type exploits a programs&#x27; vulnerabilities that allows an attacker&#x27;s commands to be concatenated onto a legitimate command with the intent of targeting other resources such as the file system or database. The system that uses a filter or a blacklist input validation, as opposed to whitelist validation is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters (or combinations of delimiters) not present in the filter or blacklist. As with other injection attacks, the attacker uses the command delimiter payload as an entry point to tunnel through the application and activate additional attacks through SQL queries, shell commands, network scanning, and so on.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.validatesInput is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Design: Perform whitelist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.Design: Limit program privileges, so if commands circumvent program input validation or filter routines then commands do not running under a privileged accountImplementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.Implementation: Use type conversions such as JDBC prepared statements.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Input Data Manipulation&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format, structure, and composition of data to an input-processing interface. By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can adversely impact the security of the target. For example, using a different character encoding might cause dangerous text to be treated as safe text. Alternatively, the attacker may use certain flags, such as file extensions, to make a target application believe that provided data should be handled using a certain interpreter when the data is not actually of the appropriate type. This can lead to bypassing protection mechanisms, forcing the target to use specific components for input processing, or otherwise causing the user&#x27;s data to be handled differently than might otherwise be expected. This attack differs from Variable Manipulation in that Variable Manipulation attempts to subvert the target&#x27;s processing through the value of the input while Input Data Manipulation seeks to control how the input is processed.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An attacker tries each of the words in a dictionary as passwords to gain access to the system via some user&#x27;s account. If the password chosen by the user was a word within the dictionary, this attack will be successful (in the absence of other mitigations). This is a specific instance of the password brute forcing attack pattern.&quot;,

      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Create a strong password policy and ensure that your system enforces this policy.Implement an intelligent password throttling mechanism. Care must be taken to assure that these mechanisms do not excessively enable account lockout attacks such as CAPEC-02.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;A Principal Spoof is a form of Identity Spoofing where an adversary pretends to be some other person in an interaction. This is often accomplished by crafting a message (either written, verbal, or visual) that appears to come from a person other than the adversary. Phishing and Pharming attacks often attempt to do this so that their attempts to gather sensitive information appear to come from a legitimate source. A Principal Spoof does not use stolen or spoofed authentication credentials, instead relying on the appearance and content of the message to reflect identity. The possible outcomes of a Principal Spoof mirror those of Identity Spoofing. (e.g., escalation of privilege and false attribution of data or activities) Likewise, most techniques for Identity Spoofing (crafting messages or intercepting and replaying or modifying messages) can be used for a Principal Spoof attack. However, because a Principal Spoof is used to impersonate a person, social engineering can be both an attack technique (using social techniques to generate evidence in support of a false identity) as well as a possible outcome (manipulating people&#x27;s perceptions by making statements or performing actions under a target&#x27;s name).&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.authenticatesSource is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Employ robust authentication processes (e.g., multi-factor authentication).&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;iFrame Overlay&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;In an iFrame overlay attack the victim is tricked into unknowingly initiating some action in one system while interacting with the UI from seemingly completely different system. While being logged in to some target system, the victim visits the attackers&#x27; malicious site which displays a UI that the victim wishes to interact with. In reality, the iFrame overlay page has a transparent layer above the visible UI with action controls that the attacker wishes the victim to execute. The victim clicks on buttons or other UI elements they see on the page which actually triggers the action controls in the transparent overlaying layer. Depending on what that action control is, the attacker may have just tricked the victim into executing some potentially privileged (and most undesired) functionality in the target system to which the victim is authenticated. The basic problem here is that there is a dichotomy between what the victim thinks he or she is clicking on versus what he or she is actually clicking on.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.disablesiFrames is False&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Configuration: Disable iFrames in the Web browser.Operation: When maintaining an authenticated session with a privileged target system, do not use the same browser to navigate to unfamiliar sites to perform other activities. Finish working with the target system and logout first before proceeding to other tasks.Operation: If using the Firefox browser, use the NoScript plug-in that will help forbid iFrames.&quot;,

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;File Content Injection&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;An attack of this type exploits the host&#x27;s trust in executing remote content, including binary files. The files are poisoned with a malicious payload (targeting the file systems accessible by the target software) by the adversary and may be passed through standard channels such as via email, and standard web content like PDF and multimedia files. The adversary exploits known vulnerabilities or handling routines in the target processes. Vulnerabilities of this type have been found in a wide variety of commercial applications from Microsoft Office to Adobe Acrobat and Apple Safari web browser. When the adversary knows the standard handling routines and can identify vulnerabilities and entry points, they can be exploited by otherwise seemingly normal content. Once the attack is executed, the adversary&#x27;s program can access relative directories such as C:Program Files or other standard system directories to launch further attacks. In a worst case scenario, these programs are combined with other propagation logic and work as a virus.&quot;,
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;target.controls.hasAccessControl is False and (target.controls.sanitizesInput is False or target.controls.validatesInput is False)&quot;,
      &quot;mitigations&quot;: &quot;Design: Enforce principle of least privilegeDesign: Validate all input for content including files. Ensure that if files and remote content must be accepted that once accepted, they are placed in a sandbox type location so that lower assurance clients cannot write up to higher assurance processes (like Web server processes for example)Design: Execute programs with constrained privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities. Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote execution.Design: Proxy communication to host, so that communications are terminated at the proxy, sanitizing the requests before forwarding to server host.Implementation: Virus scanning on hostImplementation: Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and processes. The goal of host integrity monitoring is to be aware when a security issue has occurred so that incident response and other forensic activities can begin.&quot;,
