# k8s_kind_map.yaml -- Kubernetes resource kind to PyTM element kind mapping.
#
# Maps each K8S resource type to a lightweight PyTM-style element category.
# Used by PyTMGenerator to build threat model elements from parsed YAML.
#
# PyTM element kinds:
#   Process        -- compute workloads (pods, deployments, etc.)
#   Dataflow       -- network traffic carriers (services, ingress)
#   Datastore      -- persistent or configuration data (secrets, configmaps)
#   Boundary       -- network/namespace boundaries (network policies)
#   Actor          -- identities and RBAC bindings (service accounts, roles)
#   ExternalEntity -- auto-generated for public-facing resources
